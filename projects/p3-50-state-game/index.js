/*
 * The majority of this project is done in JavaScript.
 *
 * 1. Start the timer when the click button is hit. Also, you must worry about
 *    how it will decrement (hint: setInterval).
 * 2. Check the input text with the group of states that has not already been
 *    entered. Note that this should only work if the game is currently in
 * 3. Realize when the user has entered all of the states, and let him/her know
 *    that he/she has won (also must handle the lose scenario). The timer must
 *    be stopped as well.
 *
 * There may be other tasks that must be completed, and everyone's implementation
 * will be different. Make sure you Google! We urge you to post in Piazza if
 * you are stuck.
