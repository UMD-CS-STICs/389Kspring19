# Midterm Project
#### Out: 3/16/19 | Deadline: 4/12/19 11:00 AM

### Overview

In this project, you will tie together everything you have learned up to now in the semester.

The application you will build is a "crowdsourced data application".

You will utilze the technologies we learned (HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, Express, and Handlebars) to create an API and front-end website with interactivity for your data.

### Objectives

The purpose of this project is to create a fully functioning **"crowdsourced data application"**.

First, you must select a topic for your project to be on. Example topics could be (you cannot use any of these for your project):

- Local Dogs for Adoption
- Movie Reviews
- UMD Clubs and Activities
- Rock Climbing Gyms

Topics should ideally be people/places/things that can be crowdsourced by users of your application. Throught this project specification, we will use **Local Dog for Adoption** as an example.

This project is largely open ended. The only requirement is to satisfy all parts of the `Specifications` section below, which are broad and flexible. Outside of that, you are free to be creative and make something you are proud of.

### Grading

You fill submit both the application source as well as a `documentation.md` file that documents how you implemented each part of the project.

Grading will be done using the `documentation.md` file to test your application.

Each specificiation has two types of requirements:
- (REQ): These are requirements **must** be followed. Failue to do so can result in up to 50% point deductions for the entire project.
- (X pt): These specifications are worth X points.

### Setup

There is a provided a shell that has all the dependencies you need set up. We have also included several libaries you will need in `package.json`. Clone the shell and run `npm install`.

### Specifications


1. **Data Format and Storage**

    - (REQ) Data should be stored similar to how the Pokemon API and the blog engine was set up
    - (5 pt) Each data entity should have at least 5 associated keys
    - (5 pt) The data entity should have one of each String, Number, and Array type.
       - Example a movie review can contain a numerical rating, a director, and an array of reviews.
    


2. **Add New Data**

    Users will need to be able to add data to your local storage. Users will be able to add data in two ways:

    - (10 pt) Submitting an HTML form. The form should have an input for each data  field.
    - (10 pt) Sending a `POST` request to an API endpoint. The API endpoint must    take in entry for each data field.

    In `documentation.md`, you will need to include:
    - At which route the HTML form lives on the website
    - At which route the `POST` API endpoint can be accessed.
    - An example Node.js `POST` request using the `request` module to the API   endpoint.

    **`documentation.md` example**:
    ```markdown
    ### 2. Add New Data

    HTML form route: `/addDog`
    POST endpoint route: `/api/addDog`

    Example Node.js POST request to endpoint:
    var request = require("request");

    var options = {
        method: 'POST',
        url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/addDog',
        headers: {
            'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
        },
        form: {
            name: 'Cupcake',
            breed: 'German Shepherd',
            image: "http://i.imgur.com/iGLcfkN.jpg",
            age: 10,
            characteristics: ["Brown", "Black", "Sleepy", "Lazy"]
        }
    };

    request(options, function (error, response, body) {
      if (error) throw new Error(error);

      console.log(body);
    });
    ```

3. **View Data**

    Users should be able to view all data in two ways:

    - (REQ) The HTML pages should be generated using Handlebars
    - (10 pt) At the home `/` route, you should display every data point in an  HTML Page.
    - (10 pt) At another API `GET` endpoint, you should return all data points as   JSON.

    In `documentation.md`, you will need to include:
    - The **route** for the API endpoint that returns all data.


    **`documentation.md` example**:
    ```markdown
    ### 3. View Data

    GET endpoint route: `/api/getDogs`

    ```

4. **Search Data**

    Also on the home page, you should implement an **auto-updating search feature** .

    Select an appropriate field to run your searches on.

    When the user first visits the home `/` page, they should see all data points.

    - (15 pt) As the user types in the search bar, filter the results on the page   to those that match the search query. The results should be **auto-updating**. This means that for every keystroke, the results should be updated. The page should NOT refresh while typing and searching.
    - (5 pt) If there is no match, then display text indicating that there are no   matches.

    Note: Feel free to use any NPM modules or JavaScript libraries to help you complete this task.

    **Example:**

    I chose to implement search on Dog names. Suppose I have dogs `"nelson"`,  `"nelley"`, and `"noslen"`. As soon as I type `"Ne"` (without hitting enter), the  list should be filtered to only include `"nelson"` and `"nelley"`. If I type `"Nee"`, then I should see something like "There are no dogs with the name "Nee".

    In `documentation.md`, you will need to include:
    - Which field you chose to conduct the search on. If you pick a string field, please make sure it is case-insensitive.

    **`documentation.md` example**:
    ```markdown
    ### 4. Search Data

    Search Field: name

    ```

5. **Navigation Pages**

    On the home `/` page, you should also have a **navigation bar**. This navigation bar will have **5 links**, and should be visible on every page.

    The navigation bar links should filter your data in some way.

    As an example, for the Dogs example, we could have:
    - Heavy Dogs: Lists all dogs over 20.0 pounds
    - Select a Breed: Displays a list of breeds that you can use to filter.
    - Young Dog: Lists all dogs younger than 4 years old.
    - Random Dog: Showcases a random dog.
    - Alphabetical Dogs: Lists all dogs in alphabetical order by name.

    (REQ) All additional pages must be rendered using handlebars.

    (5 pt) 5 navigation bar links visible on each page (Hint: Use `main.handlebars`).

    (15 pt) 5 pages linked to from the navigation bar that display the appropriate filtered data.

    In `documentation.md`, you will need to include:
    - Each of the 5 navigation filters
    - The routes for each of the additional pages

    **`documentation.md` example**:
    ```markdown
    ### 5. Navigation Pages

    Navigation Filters
    1. Heavy Dogs -> `/heaviest`
    2. Select a Breed -> `/breed/:breed_name`
    3. Young Dog -> `/youngest`
    4. Random Dog -> `/random`
    5. Alphabetical Dogs -> `/alphabetical`

    ```

### Submission

We will be Heroku [Heroku](http://heroku.com) to submit one link per project.

At the top of your project, include the **Heroku link** (ex: https://myapp.herokuapp.com) at the top of your `documentation.md` file, like so:

Submit just the `documentation.md` file to the submit server.
